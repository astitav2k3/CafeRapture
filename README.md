# CafeRapture - Interactive React Demo

Features:
- Interactive menu filters (Breakfast, Lunch, Drinks, Desserts)
- Smooth animations via framer-motion
- Reservation form connected to FormSubmit (replace with your email)
- TailwindCSS styling (requires Tailwind setup)

Quick start:
1. Install dependencies:
   npm install
   # or
   yarn

2. Start dev server:
   npm start

3. Replace the FormSubmit action URL in src/components/CafeLanding.jsx:
   action="https://formsubmit.co/YOUR_EMAIL_HERE"

Notes:
- This project assumes you will run Tailwind (postcss) build or use CRA + Tailwind setup.
- If you prefer, you can copy `src/components/CafeLanding.jsx` into an existing React + Tailwind project.
